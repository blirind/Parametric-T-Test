What is AB Test?
Welcome to the business world!
Business world has always been searching for simplier, faster and cheaper solutions for specific problems.
Many methods has been tried to get the best output. One of them is AB Test, which for decades is being used
by companies to solve the "scientific difference" problems.
But what is AB Test at all?
AB Test is considered as the first step toward understanding the path of our business. Recently names also as
a "bucket testing" and "split-run testing", AB Test is a user experience research methodology. With this, we
can compare statistically the meaning of using or not the new approach of our business; the impact of the new
design of our website; the difference of outcome of our employer and many more.


Which statistics are included in AB Test?
AB Test includes application of statistical hypothesis testing or better said "two-sample hypothesis testing".
That means AB Test is used to compare the difference between two samples considering two assumptions.
First assumption of parametric AB Test is Normal distribution (Normality test) and the second is Homogeneity
of variances (homoscedasticity).
Normality test - Calculates if dataset is well-modeled by a normal distribution.
Homogeneity of variances - Means that if all of it's random variables have the same finite variance.

Example
Business Problem: A company recently made it available new type of bidding named "Average bidding" to replace
the previous one named "Maximum bidding" for advertisement bids.
One of our customers, decided to test this new feature. Is the new "Average bidding" bringing more sales than
the "Maximum bidding"?
Dataset Story: Users in the datasets is using our customers products. Change on advertisement bidding type is
thought to have a different effect on sales, adv clicks, etc.
There are two separate data sets:
Control Group - The dataset formed by using "Maximum bidding"
Test Group - The dataset formed by using "Average bidding"
Variables: Impressions, Click, Purchasing, Earnings.
